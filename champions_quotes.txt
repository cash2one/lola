"Art must exist beyond reason."
"They call me mad. All artists are mad."
"I will not suffer this ugliness."
"I cannot be good. I must be perfection."

"It's so difficult to work under these conditions."
"My talent justifies all actions."
"I am at my best only during the performance."
"I am pure. My work is pure."
"My theater is the mind."
"Art should terrify."
"No poet's words could match my craft."
"Death should never be quick. It should be an opera."
"I shall choreograph this affair."
"What sweet sadness is killing?"
"The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly."
"Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own."
"This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it."
"Perfection isn't good enough."
"Behind every mask... is another mask."
"There is nothing for me but this."
"I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills."
"Until they stop me, I will keep going."
"I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs."
"Only to the audience do I show my true face."
"Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me."
"I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time."
"I am a slave to this passion."
"My work asks questions, it never has answers."
"Which is the lie? The mask, or my face?"
"An icon doesn't have to explain himself."
"I wonder what they think when they see me."
"Yes, the gun is ironic."
"I like a violent composition."
"This would be easier if blood came in more colours."
"Let's start the show."
"The ecstasy of opening night."
"Smiles and screams, I bring both."
"If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work?"
"I was paid to put on a killer show."
"My clients expect the best."
"They will dance, they will sing, they will die!"
"A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood."
"It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance."
"My critics are... usually short-lived."
"If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed."
"I serve a discerning clientele."
"Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly."
"I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims."
"I... orchestrate death."
"I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling."
"The moment before the shot... is painful."
"It is only when the gun fires that I am alive."
"Mmm... the ecstasy of killing."
"The trigger on a loaded weapon... it whispers for us to act."
"I can't live without the euphoria of performance."
"Happiness... is a warm gun."
"I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do."
"I envy silence... because I must be loud."
"You lack imagination."
"I have elaborate plans for you."
"Killing you will be one of my finest works."
"You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you."
"Only my actions will make you memorable."
"It hurts so good..."
"You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast."
"My dear countryman, you remind me how little our culture has advanced."
"I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past."
"The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions."
"I do what others will not. That alone is innovation."
"I remember your father! He thought he could censor me."
"I have been planning your final performance for a very... long... time."
"You helped lock me away. You tried to stop my work. My art cannot be contained."
"Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered."
"Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in."
"You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed."
"You think you can stop my performance?"
"An understudy can't upstage me."
"I remember your master. He was worth remembering."
"You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance."
"You belong in the shadows. No audience could love you."
"I offer an exclusive service. You'll find I murder the competition."
"I've been asked to do so many boring performances in your nation."
"Your people mistake loudness for import."
"Noxians treat killing as a sport. It is an art."
"How gauche your nation is."
"Your war was an impressive production, but it lacked soul."
"You shout and throw machetes? How quaint."
"Clearly you've never performed in Ionia."
"I find your work very, very... obvious."
"Wait for your cue! You're only here to herald my entrance."
"What a terrible arrangement."
"The always-enchanting tale of star-crossed lovers."
"When you speak, I don't hear god, I hear an idiot babbling."
"Here's the thing, I don't need your god, I need more time for my production."
"You can take my soul... if you'll shut up."
"There is such a thing as 'too much gold', my dear."
"I thought diamonds were a girl's best friend."
"So many guns, all lacking in meaning or artistry."
"Your finale will be a duet."
"Your story is revenge with guns and ghosts. How droll."
"I suppose you embody a primitive minimalism, but you lack my technique."
"Break a leg! Hehe, oh. 'Break a leg', hehe... ah, delightful. I do cut myself up."
"Your music lacks the cruelty of a masterpiece."
"You should learn the power of silence."
"Step out of my light! They call it background music!"
"Your work will be forgotten. I am ahead of my time!"
"How inelegant your words are. Surely a fool wrote your script."
"You have too many lines."
"Why would anyone listen to a creature so ugly?"
"Heh... hehe... that hat is ridiculous, now... who let you wear that horrible thing?"
"Oh, before you ask, yes, your whole ensemble makes you look fat. Very fat."
"Only perfectio - gah! ... only perfection is acceptable."

"Smile! Everyone is watching!"
"Breathe in the atmosphere."
"Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire."
"There is art here, waiting."
"I inspire action."
"One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four."
"This... passion... compels me."
"Now that is what I want to see."
"Art shall blossom from your fear."
"Life has no meaning, but your death shall."
"I live for the applause, you will die for it."
"I knew you would find your mark, eventually."
"You've awoken something deep inside me."
"Face the crowd, and bleed for them."
"The face of your killer is identical to mine."
"With my technique, killing blooms into artwork!"
"Prepare... for your finale."
"Your final scene begins."

"I'll give you to the count of - time's up!"
"Duck! Hehe, just kidding, that won't help."
"Gotta' die sometime!"
"Smile! It's called gun play."

"Scream along if you know the words!"
"I've got a recital, and everyone's invited!"
"Who wants a solo?"
"Let's just behave... said no one, ever."
"Wait, I'm thinking! Urgh... how do people do this?"
"I'm trying to care but I just can't!"
"Jinx? Stands for Jinx! Durr."
"Whatever, let's just start shooting!"
"Now where was I? Oh, right, wreaking havoc!"
"Hold on! I'm about to say something really cool!"

"All part of the plan I just made up!"
"What if I had a gun that... shot other guns?"
"Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?"
"I really need a new gun. But don't tell my other guns."
"What's in my violin case? Violence."
"Guns don't kill people. I mean, until you shoot them. Then they kill everything!"
"I'm bringing guns to the knife fight! Hehe."
"Say hello to my friends of varying sizes!"
"Three guns means never having to say 'I'm sorry'."
"Welcome to Snoresville, hat lady! Population: you."

"Hey Fishbones, think we can wreak havoc forever? 'No, you should buy a home and save for retirement.' You know I can replace you, right?"

"That really hurt... my feelings."
"That was almost not close at all!"
"Slogan, catchphrase, tagline!"
"To infinity and - uh, oops. Wrong catchphrase!"
"You're not dreaming - I'm a Star Guardian now."
"Here comes a rising star."
"Let's get the sparkle party started."
"How do you like my extreme makeover?"
"Armed and dangerous - with sparkles."
"I'm a shooting star!" (laughs)
"I'll try to make this painless. Honest."
"Oh, no, don't make me break the Guardian code."
"Sorry, it's my duty to destroy you."
"I've got your starlight right here."
"Nothing personal, I'm obligated to trash you."
"I almost feel guilty about this."
"This is the best part of being a Star Guardian!"
"Sorry, First Star made me do this."
"Say hello to my little friends."
"Alright, who's feeling ferocious?"
"Don't be so hard on yourself... I'll do it for you."
"Ew! Somebody got hit with an ugly stick."
"Hey, Baron, I've seen black holes with more charm."

"Slaying dragons is not in my job description."
"Star Guardians have better things to destroy than dragons."
"Glitter trumps fire every time."
"Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the cave."
"Protecting the universe, one bullet at a time!"
"Can you believe I was chosen for this?"
"Don't let the sparkles fool you."
"Being noble takes all the fun out of fighting."
"What do you think? Mercy, or mayhem?"
"What, your guns don't talk to you?"
"I'm fighting for peace, and justice and... er... eh, whatever."
"Jury's still out on this whole Star Guardian thing."
"This is not my idea of magical."
"Hate to be ruthless but - oh, wait, no I don't!"
"Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind."
"Glory to the First Star... whatever that means."
"Star Guardian to the rescue! Am I doing it right?"
"Onward to glitter and glory!"
"We're on a mission! Just... don't remember what."
"What's next? Is it shooting? I love shooting."
"Who's up for a round of Hide and Go Shoot?"
"Yeah, I got this Star Guardian thing down."
"Does First Star have to deal with this many sparkles?"
"Warning! My guns are getting restless."
"Look at me! Pandemonium with a purpose."
"Ugh... why do Star Guardians have to play 'nice'?"
"Glitter and guns - now that's a winning combo."
"Shiro and Kuro are ready for action."
"First Star says this is all part of the plan."
"So, what's your favourite part about being a Star Guardian?"
Shiro squeaks
"Now, now, Shiro. First Star doesn't like the word slaughter."
"Hey, Shiro, what do you call someone with their head blown off?"
Shiro squeaks
"I don't know either. Let's find out!"
"So, Shiro, what was in the Star Guardian contract I signed?"
Shiro squeaks
"Yeah, TLDR."
"What's your favourite part about being a Star Guardian, Kuro?"
Kuro squeaks
"I had no idea you loved sparkles so much."
"Hey, Kuro, you know what I call five dead enemies?"
Kuro squeaks
"A great start!" (laughs)
"What do you think, Kuro? Is Star Guardian a good look for me?"
Kuro squeaks
"Next time, just lie."
"Aw, did I hurt your feelings?"
"Believe in yourself - not that it'll help."
"You're so cute when you're losing."
"I've got a fistful of glitter with your name on it!"
"Ready to get glitter bombed?"
"Not scared of my sparkles? You should be."
"Got to say, I don't miss my old guns at all."
"Wait. I look like that?"
"Is it me, or is Janna getting way too old for this?"
"Hey, Janna! You might want to look into a retirement plan."
"When First Star talks to you, something's lost in translation."
"Do your thing, Lulu... whatever that is."
"You can learn a lot from Lulu. Just not sure what."
"Quit while you're ahead, Lulu. Oh, wait, that's never."
"Loosen up, Lux. Fighting evil's supposed to be fun."
"Lux even makes boring beautiful."
"I'm positive this will hurt."
"Only Lux could make battle so boring."
"You take this Guardian thing way too seriously."
"Chill out, Poppy. Leave some for the rest of us."
"Watch out, Poppy's off to save the world again."
"Got a present for you, Poppy. It's called defeat."
"Looks like you're getting rusty."
"I AM A MECH. I AM PROGRAMMED TO LOSE."
"Hey, mech! The only good robot is a deactivated robot!"
"Guardians rules, PROJECT drools!"
"PROJECT? Ha! More like reject."
"All those PROJECT enhancements and you're still pathetic."
"Let's bring a little starlight into the Void."
"Wait, does Void refer to your home, or your head?"
"Ugh, is everything in the Void this ugly?"
"Hey, Hat Lady! Say hello to the new me."
"Poor Vi, must be killing you not to punch me."
"Now it's my turn to be the hero, Vi."
"Hey, Vi. I'm a Star Guardian now. Jealous much?"
"Hey, Graves! Have a taste of destiny!"
Jinx laughs.

"Ready to roll?"
"Your turn!"
"Meet Shiro!"
"Yes, Kuro, all my enemies fear you."
"No, Kuro, I'm the Guardian, you're the gun."
"Don't worry, Kuro, your time is coming."
"Ready to rock?"
"Unleash the beast!"
"Meet Kuro!"
"Patience, Shiro, First Star claims it's a virtue."
"Don't be jealous, Shiro, I love both my guns."
"Relax, Shiro, I'll save some for you."
"Not so fast!"
"Starlight express!"
"Talk to the hand!"
"Hold up!"
"Finger of doom!"
"I point, you die."
"Watch your step!"
"Stunning, isn't it?"
"My gift to you."
"I have the best toys."
"Double trouble!"
"Better together!"
"Two for one!"
"Double hatter!"
"Combo platter!"
"Can you say... shopping spree?"
"Can't I have one of everything?"
"Ooh, shiny!"
"I'm kind of a high roller."
"No limit on my first star card."
"Just put this on my Star Guardian tab."
"Who wants to hold the sword?"
"Look, Shiro, a new toy."
"Present for you, Kuro!"
"Who wants the red shield?"
"Look, Kuro, legendary."
"Shiro will love this."
"A guardian for a Guardian!"
"Angels? Whatever!"
"Look, Kuro! Life insurance!"
"Now we're talking, Shiro!"
"Kuro loves edgy."
"Infinitely awesome."
"The only kind of whisper I like."
"Just for you, Kuro."
"Quiet, Shiro, it's a whisper."
"Can't keep a Star Guardian down."
"Eh, just strap it to my gun."
"Shiro's been asking for this."
"Faster guns? Sold."
"Look, Shiro! Speed boost."
"Hope Kuro's not jealous."
"Eh, it needs starlight... but I'll take it."
"I'd be shocked if Shiro doesn't like this."
"Kuro, look what I've got."
"That was stellar! Get it? Star Guardian? Stellar?"
"Bam! It's lights out for you!"
"It wasn't me! My guns have minds of their own."
"You'll be missed, Janna!" Jinx laughs. "Not by me."
"Make room for the new kid on the block!"
"So, how did that taste, Lulu?"
"This almost breaks my heart, Lux."
"I killed Poppy!" Jinx laughs. "Who's next?"
"Now that you're dead... can I keep the hat?"
"Sorry, Urgot. It's just a Star Guardian thing."
"Justice never felt so good!"
"It's more fun when they fight back."
"What's wrong with a little carnage?"
"I'm feeling generous. Bullets for everyone!"
"You get a bullet! You get a bullet! Everyone gets a bullet!"
"Star light, star bright, another turret destroyed tonight!"
"Can't get enough of these."
"I'm amazing. Not immortal."
"Bottoms up."
"Sweet. Don't mind if I do."
"Snack time."
"Delicious and nutritious."
"You can't hide from starlight."
"This'll shed some light on things."
"Now I see everything."
"Peekaboo." Jinx laughs.
"I was just getting warmed up!"
"Say goodbye, my little guns!"
"They say parting is such sweet sorrow... they're idiots."
"I'm taking my guns and going home."
"Ugh, I hate this dancing part."
"Don't worry, Lux. You know I'll be back."
"Hey, Lux, do Guardians get lunch breaks?"
"Don't forget... to miss me, Lux... "
"Ugh... whatever... "
"...seriously? That's a bummer... "
"The horror... the horror... ha ha... "
"Oh no. I'm dying."
"Don't... worry... Kuro... we'll be back."
"Relax, Shiro... revenge is sweet."
"The money's... buried in the... "
"Oops, forgot to read my Guardian handbook."
"Back in action! Miss me?"
"You can't keep a Star Guardian down."
"Ugh, enough with the glitter!"
"My guns need to be brushed - or something."
"The worst part about being a Star Guardian - all this glitter."
"Shiro and Kuro have a serious shedding problem."
"What kind of guns like sparkles anyway?"
"Glitter bomb!"
"Seriously, you two need a bath."
"I never realised stardust was so... messy."
"Always wanted to leave a mark... but not so sparkly."
"Spring cleaning!"
"Only as good as your guns."
"A Star Guardian's best friend."
"Twinkle, twinkle, lethal star!"
